/*The ChangeType component simulates another an editor for a quiz application that provides a way to change the type of a quiz question by pressing a button. Recall from the Objects task that Quiz Questions can come in either Multiple Choice or Short Answer.

You will need a single state to handle whether the type is multiple_choice_question or short_answer_question.
The type of the state should be QuestionType, not string.
There should be a button labelled Change Type that changes the state from one type to the other.
When the type is multiple_choice_question, the text Multiple Choice should be visible.
When the type is short_answer_question, the text Short Answer should be visible.
The initial type must be short_answer_question.*/
